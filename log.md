# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

# 100Days of Code

### Day 0: 5/19/19

**Initial Thoughts**
Where I'm at: Yesterday I spent some time trying to figure out how to fork this repo to start this challenge because I'm trying to be a part of the latest Chingu Voyage and want to get some momentum going. Initially I didn't know how to make changes to any of the files which in my case edit the rules.md file to change the date and push it and first I just cloned the original repo
not realizing i cant just change that hence having to fork insted for my use only. I'm excited already because I feel like I'm learning so much already and feel good about the Chingu community and how helpful and positive it is which for me having fear and insecurity about coding is just what I need. 

**Progress**
Succesfully forked #100daysofcode repo and am on my way

### Day 1: 5/20/2019

**Progress**
Finished pair programming challenge for Chingu which is a relief even though it wasn't a super
hard challenge but for me it was hard enough and i feel i got to help out and be a part of the solution. Havne't made progress on the clone solo project. I was spinning my wheels on trying to figure out how to show the current date and time. I feel a little discouraged but I'm not giving up. 

**Thoughts**

I hope i can finish this solo project and move on to the actual project but not at the expense of my sanity. I need to ask for help and stay positive because I'm my own worst critic.

###Day 2: 5/21/2019

**Progress** 
Spent some time chatting with Chingu partner about various solo project related topics such as
VS Code and GitHub and VS Code extionsions. We're both kind of on the same page as far as how 
far along we are with the project which isn't far. I added the font from Google and formatted the time with JS for one of the requirements. I can't figure out how to make the AM or PM with the time
be smaller than the time. 

**Thoughts** 
I'm perfectly ok with not being able to finish this project because I'm trying and if I don't move
on to the actual project I know what I have to work on.

###Day 3: 5/22/2019

**Progress** 
Got time in correct format! Was hacky but yeah. Reached out which for me has been a barrier I'm learning to overcome. Still have a long ways to go with this but I'm happy I got that part. 

**Thoughts** 
I was looking at software jobs on Craigslist and is very intimidating. I applied to a couple. I need a plan so I don't look like an idiot should I get an interview. I need to know what I want
to do within software.

###Day 4: 5/26/2019

**Progress** 
None. I'm confused and frustrated. I managed to get a clock; spent bunch of time going nowhere. 

**Thoughts**
I hope I don't give up and keep pushing forward and am smart of about this process/journey because
there is nothing else I want to do as a vocation but this because I can't see what else I could do to provide for myself but it seems like I'm so far away from being a developer. I'ts hard to even make sense of what I'm thinking and feeling about "development"; I feel like the most important kind of development I need is self-development and hack myself. I don't want to settle in any
area of my life but it seems I've made no progress yet am feeling like I've wasted and am wasting
time and don't have a life I want which I know is not related to development but so much of life IS
what you do for money and going to school and getting an education and spending all that time and energy was to make more money to have a better life and I don't have more money. I know more money
won't make me happier but I'm also not "happy" or doesn't sit well with me that I'm a server. 


###Day 4: 6/20/19

**Progress**
It seems the solo project this time around is easier but still have a ways to go. I'm happy about the little yet a lot I'm learning; putting stuff together. 

**Thoughts**
There is so many jumbled thoughts and emotions going through me. I just want to finish this and learn shit. I'm going to push through the frustration and keep at it no matter how long it takes. I know if I consistently code and push myself when I get stuck there is no way I can't not be learning. I have to talk to myself positevely and just be patient with myself. Sure there's more BS
I can say but the bottom line is that I just got to build shit. Sure I can have fun in the process 
but the point is to develop and create.

###Day 5: 8/22/19

**Progress**

Progress in the area of coding has been miniscule; I've reapplied to Chingu without having been able
to move on to the actual project. I don't think I'll move on this time. I am looking at Outreachy. 
What I'm getting at is that coding isn't the priority I feel it has to be to get the results I want.
I'm not giving up but am not putting in the time I know I have to but there is more important things
in my life right now that have to take precedence over coding. Things are slowing down at work and intend to devote more time to coding and build stuff. Of course I want to have a personal portofolio. On it I want to include links to my YouTube channel where I have my drumming at church. 
I also want to talk about spirituality and my faith journey in a non-religious way. I also want to talk about yoga and the place it has in my life and how yoga is important for my overall wellbeing
which helps in all areas of my life. I've stopped thinking I have to be a "designer" or super creative to make a website look cool. I have a personality and qualities that make me unique and think I'm a pretty cool person therefore can use my portfolio to show the world a bit about myself. 

**Thoughts**
Did I mention I started Chingu again. I struggled a bit there with cloning my repo locally
to be able to use VS Code to work on the pre-work but got through it. The pre-work is due the 27th
and honestly don't think I'm going to be able to finish. I'm doing what I can and don't want to
burn myself out because I believe every moment of my short time here on earth should be pleasant;
and that is not to say I don't believe in hard work and that there isn't a direct correlation between how much I work on something or give of myself to something and the success of it
or tangible awesomeness out of it. I believe I should do everything with all my heart and if 
not shouldn't do it at all.
