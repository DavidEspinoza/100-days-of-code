# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

# 100Days of Code

### Day 0: 5/19/19

**Initial Thoughts**
Where I'm at: Yesterday I spent some time trying to figure out how to fork this repo to start this challenge because I'm trying to be a part of the latest Chingu Voyage and want to get some momentum going. Initially I didn't know how to make changes to any of the files which in my case edit the rules.md file to change the date and push it and first I just cloned the original repo
not realizing i cant just change that hence having to fork insted for my use only. I'm excited already because I feel like I'm learning so much already and feel good about the Chingu community and how helpful and positive it is which for me having fear and insecurity about coding is just what I need. 

**Progress**
Succesfully forked #100daysofcode repo and am on my way
