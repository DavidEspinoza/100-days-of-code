# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

# 100Days of Code

### Day 0: 5/19/19

**Initial Thoughts**
Where I'm at: Yesterday I spent some time trying to figure out how to fork this repo to start this challenge because I'm trying to be a part of the latest Chingu Voyage and want to get some momentum going. Initially I didn't know how to make changes to any of the files which in my case edit the rules.md file to change the date and push it and first I just cloned the original repo
not realizing i cant just change that hence having to fork insted for my use only. I'm excited already because I feel like I'm learning so much already and feel good about the Chingu community and how helpful and positive it is which for me having fear and insecurity about coding is just what I need. 

**Progress**
Succesfully forked #100daysofcode repo and am on my way

### Day 1: 5/20/2019

**Progress**
Finished pair programming challenge for Chingu which is a relief even though it wasn't a super
hard challenge but for me it was hard enough and i feel i got to help out and be a part of the solution. Havne't made progress on the clone solo project. I was spinning my wheels on trying to figure out how to show the current date and time. I feel a little discouraged but I'm not giving up. 

**Thoughts**

I hope i can finish this solo project and move on to the actual project but not at the expense of my sanity. I need to ask for help and stay positive because I'm my own worst critic.

###Day 2: 5/21/2019

**Progress** 
Spent some time chatting with Chingu partner about various solo project related topics such as
VS Code and GitHub and VS Code extionsions. We're both kind of on the same page as far as how 
far along we are with the project which isn't far. I added the font from Google and formatted the time with JS for one of the requirements. I can't figure out how to make the AM or PM with the time
be smaller than the time. 

**Thoughts** 
I'm perfectly ok with not being able to finish this project because I'm trying and if I don't move
on to the actual project I know what I have to work on.

###Day 3: 5/22/2019

**Progress** 
Got time in correct format! Was hacky but yeah. Reached out which for me has been a barrier I'm learning to overcome. Still have a long ways to go with this but I'm happy I got that part. 

**Thoughts** 
I was looking at software jobs on Craigslist and is very intimidating. I applied to a couple. I need a plan so I don't look like an idiot should I get an interview. I need to know what I want
to do within software.
